# Bioinformatics-_Project

This repository contains the source code and the results from my Bioinformatics Projects, durin the Masters degree.

In here it possible to find fucntions that allow to:

  __-->__ Generate staphylococcus pahges datasets in _.csv_ format (however these functions can be changed in order to generate datasets for other organims). 
  
  __-->__ Find specific proteins inside the genome and generate _.txt_ files conatining the genomes with the wanted proteins.
  
  __-->__ Get the accession genomes that do not have the wanted proteins inseide the previous generated dataset.
  
  __-->__ Get proteins nucleotide sequences into a _.fasta_ file, based on their id or on their location within the genome.
  
  __-->__ Performing multi-sequence aligments.
  
  __-->__ Draw phylogenetic trees from .dnd files.
  
  __-->__ Draw cladrograms from _.aln_ --> _.nex_ files.
  
  __-->__ Identify SNP from _.vcf_ files.
