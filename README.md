# Bioinformatics-_Project

This repository contains the source code and the results from my Bioinformatics Projects, durin the Masters degree.

In here it possible to find fucntions that allow to:

  __-->__ Generate staphylococcus pahges datasets (however these functions can be changed in order to generate datasets for other organims). 
  
  --> Find specific proteins inside the genome and generate .txt files conatining the genomes with the wanted proteins.
  
  --> Get the accession genomes that do not have the wanted proteins inseide the previous generated dataset.
  
  --> Get proteins nucleotide sequences into a .fasta file, based on their id or on their location within the genome.
  
  --> Performing multi-sequence aligments.
  
  --> Draw phylogenetic trees from .dnd files.
  
  --> Draw
